# Covid-19-Data-Analysis
## Project Overview
Welcome to my COVID-19 data analysis project. This repository demonstrates my experience with R, Quarto, data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The project uses COVID-19 data from South Africa to extract meaningful insights and present them in a clear and intuitive format. The analysis was conducted in RStudio using a Quarto notebook (.qmd).
## Project Description
This project follows several key steps:

1. Data Sourcing: Collecting COVID-19 datasets from publicly available sources relevant to South Africa and global trends.

2. Data Handling: Cleaning and preparing the data, including handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring consistency.

3. Data Analysis: Performing exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and trends in COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths.

4. Data Visualisation: Recreating existing graphs and creating new ones to illustrate trends, patterns, and comparisons across countries and regions.

## Usage

This repository is primarily for viewing and learning purposes. To explore the analysis and visualisations:

Open final.qmd in RStudio or Quarto to view the full analysis, including code and interactive visualisations.

Data files are stored in data/ if you want to reproduce or modify the analysis.
## Notes on this Repository

This project demonstrates my data analysis and visualization skills in R.

All data sources are publicly available and cited within the notebook.

The project was completed as part of my academic work and serves as a representation of my skills at the time.
